Shifty is a small, community driven, palette generation script based on the PyxelEdit feature.&nbsp;It offers multiple different palette generation options; from shading to mixing,&nbsp;as well as the ability to customize its various settings to your liking.

The project was started by&nbsp;domjohn&nbsp;over on the Aseprite forums, where many people would continue contributing to it. Mine is just version 6 of this community project. It comes with several fixes, a cleaned up UI, and a bunch of additional features for you to play around with. I have also gone through the effort of cleaning up the code base in case anyone wants to help continue supporting the project. I will continue to update it as I see fit, adding/tweaking features if I feel like the script could use it.

This script is a collaborative effort by the Aseprite community and is provided at no cost. If you have been forced to pay for this script, it is a scam, and the page should be reported to the one of the active maintainers.
