<h3>Shifty is a small, community driven, palette generation script based on the PyxelEdit feature.&nbsp;It offers multiple different palette generation options; from shading to mixing,&nbsp;as well as the ability to customize its various settings to your liking.<br>- - - - -<br>The project was started by&nbsp;domjohn&nbsp;over on the Aseprite forums, where many people would continue contributing to it. Mine is just version 6 of this community project. It comes with several fixes, a cleaned up UI, and a bunch of additional features for you to play around with. I have also gone through the effort of cleaning up the code base in case anyone wants to help continue supporting the project. I will continue to update it as I see fit, adding/tweaking features if I feel like the script could use it.<br>- - - - -<br>This script is a collaborative effort by the Aseprite community and is provided at no cost. If you have been forced to pay for this script, it is a scam, and the page should be reported to the one of the active maintainers.<br>- - - - -<br>Source - <a href="https://github.com/SaltSouls/Shifty">Github<br></a>Original Post - <a href="https://community.aseprite.org/t/script-more-color-shading-options/3668">Aseprite Forums<br></a>Screenshot Artist -&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Xeleph_">Xeleph</a><br>- - - - -<br>Credits:<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://www.aseprite.org/">David Capello</a>: Aseprite<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://github.com/dominickjohn/aseprite/tree/master">domjon</a>: v1.0.0-2.0.0<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://github.com/yashar98/aseprite/tree/main">yashar98</a>: v3.0.0<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://github.com/Daeyangae/aseprite">Daeyangae</a>: v3.1.0<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://github.com/hoelzlmanuel/aseprite-color-shading">hoelzlmanuel</a>: v4.0.0<br><a style="font-family: inherit;" href="https://github.com/GerryLCDF/Aseprite-Color-Shading-v5.0/tree/main">GerryLCDF</a>: v5.0.0-5.0.5</h3>
